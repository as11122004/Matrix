# Matrix
HTML files which contain Hyperlinks to access several mathematical theorems in a super convenient way.
I am doing this for each separate classes from 9 to 12 of five different educational councils, i.e, WBBSC, WBCHSE, ISCE, ISC and CBSE.

**How this thing works:-**

1)Download all the files and keep them in the same folder.

(If all the files aren't downloaded and kept in the same folder then it won't work).
viz. If you want class 9 theorems then download all the files under that title. Similarly, it goes for class 10,11,12.
Each "class" folder contains theorems needed by all councils for that particular class only. 

2)Go to the "Home.html" or "home" file first. (Don't open other files !)

3)Now surf through the hyperlinked pages and you'll know what I am trying to doing.

4)If still having trouble with this, ** CONTACT ME. E-MAIL: sikdaramartya@gmail.com **


**Want to work with me ?**

1)Download the files. 
2)Open the "HOME" file. 
3)Surf through it.
4)Understand what I am trying to doing.
5)Ask me for the repository access permission.
6)Start working.
